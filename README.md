# Go Game Detection

### First rudmentary engine

The board is found via user input, a Hugh transform done by opencv HughPLine 
implementation and the implementation of an algorithm to filter the found 
lines and determine the intersections of lines. This is quiet inacurrat an 
needs improvement.

The project is tested best in an virtual environment, which needs numpy and
opencv.
